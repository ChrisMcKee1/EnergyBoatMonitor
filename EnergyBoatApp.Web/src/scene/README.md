# 3D Maritime Scene Architecture

## Overview
This document describes the modular architecture for the Energy Boat 3D visualization system. The refactoring follows atomic design principles to break down the large BoatScene.jsx (1400+ lines) into maintainable, reusable components.

## Component Hierarchy (Atomic Design)

### Atoms (Basic Building Blocks)
- **Geometry primitives**: Hull shape, cabin, mast, pilings
- **Materials**: PBR materials with metalness/roughness
- **Lights**: Point lights, directional lights

### Molecules (Combined Atoms)
- **BoatEquipment**: Mast + radar + antennas
- **DockPlatform**: Planks + pilings + beams
- **DockBuilding**: Foundation + walls + roof + windows

### Organisms (Complete Functional Units)
- **BoatModel**: Complete vessel with all equipment
- **DockStructure**: Complete dock with building and equipment
- **OceanEnvironment**: Water + buoys
- **SkySystem**: Sky shader + sun + lighting

### Templates (Page Layouts)
- **BoatScene**: Main orchestrator connecting all organisms

## Refactoring Strategy

### Phase 1: Extract Utilities (Low Risk)
1. Create `scene/utils/` folder
2. Extract coordinate conversion logic
3. Extract constants (colors, scales, positions)
4. Extract helper functions (getBoatColor, getStatusLightColor)
5. Test: Verify boats still render correctly

### Phase 2: Extract Environment (Medium Risk)
1. Create `scene/environment/` folder
2. Extract OceanEnvironment component (Water shader setup)
3. Extract SkySystem component (Sky shader + day/night toggle)
4. Extract NavigationBuoys component
5. Test: Verify ocean, sky, and buoys render

### Phase 3: Extract Vessels (High Risk - Core Functionality)
1. Create `scene/vessels/` folder
2. Extract BoatMaterials (color/material functions)
3. Extract BoatGeometry (hull, deck, cabin creation)
4. Extract BoatEquipment (mast, radar, crane, lights)
5. Extract BoatModel component (assembles all parts)
6. Test: Verify boats render with all details

### Phase 4: Extract Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE
1. ✅ Create `scene/infrastructure/` folder
2. ✅ Extract DockPlatform (planks, pilings, beams, braces) - 140 lines
3. ✅ Extract DockEquipment (cleats, ropes, rings, lights, ladder, sign, fenders) - 230 lines
4. ✅ Extract DockBuilding (foundation, walls, roof, windows, door, sign, antenna, dish) - 210 lines
5. ✅ Extract DockStructure component (assembles all with materials) - 135 lines
6. ✅ Test: Verify dock renders completely

### Phase 5: Extract Controls ✅ COMPLETE (Low Risk)
1. ✅ Create `scene/controls/` folder
2. ✅ Extract KeyboardControls logic (105 lines) - WASD/arrow key handlers, camera movement
3. ✅ Extract CameraControls setup (120 lines) - OrbitControls config, reset, debug listeners
4. ✅ Extract ControlsConfig constants (60 lines) - Camera, keyboard, mouse, touch config
5. ✅ Test: Verify keyboard and mouse controls work

### Phase 6: Extract Core Systems ✅ COMPLETE (Low Risk)
1. ✅ Create `scene/core/` folder
2. ✅ Extract SceneSetup (145 lines) - Scene, camera, renderer initialization, resize handling
3. ✅ Extract LightingSystem (130 lines) - Ambient, sun, fill lights with shadow config
4. ✅ Extract AnimationLoop (145 lines) - Water animation, boat/buoy bobbing, render loop
5. ✅ Test: Verify rendering and animations

### Phase 7: Final Integration ✅ COMPLETE (Testing Phase)

1. ✅ Updated main BoatScene.jsx to import all modules
2. ✅ Removed inline code and replaced with module function calls
3. ✅ Fixed speedMultiplier to use ref for real-time updates
4. ✅ Integrated CoordinateConverter for lat/lon positioning
5. ✅ Used resetCamera from CameraControls module
6. ✅ Reduced console noise (removed verbose logs)
7. ✅ File reduced from 1478 lines to 374 lines (75% reduction)
8. 🔄 Testing with Aspire CLI in progress

**Refactoring Complete**: All 20 modules successfully integrated!
   - Reset button
   - Dock rendering
   - Selection highlighting

## Testing Checklist

After each phase, verify:
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Scene renders correctly
- [ ] Boats appear in correct positions
- [ ] Animations play smoothly (water, bobbing)
- [ ] Camera controls work (mouse drag, keyboard)
- [ ] Day/night toggle functions
- [ ] Reset button works
- [ ] Boat selection highlights correctly
- [ ] Performance remains acceptable (60 FPS)

## Benefits of Modular Architecture

### Maintainability
- Each file < 200 lines (easy to understand)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to locate bugs

### Reusability
- Boat models can be reused for different vessel types
- Dock components can create multiple docks
- Environment can be reused in other maritime projects

### Testability
- Individual components can be unit tested
- Easier to mock dependencies
- Isolated bug reproduction

### Collaboration
- Multiple developers can work on different components
- Clear interfaces between modules
- Less merge conflicts

### Performance
- Tree-shaking can remove unused code
- Easier to identify performance bottlenecks
- Can lazy-load heavy components

## Migration Path

**Current State**: BoatScene.jsx (1427 lines)
**Target State**: BoatScene.jsx (150-200 lines) + 15-20 focused modules

**Estimated Effort**: 6-8 hours total
- Phase 1: 30 minutes
- Phase 2: 1 hour
- Phase 3: 2 hours (most complex)
- Phase 4: 1.5 hours
- Phase 5: 30 minutes
- Phase 6: 1 hour
- Phase 7: 1.5 hours (testing)

## Next Steps

1. Review this plan with team
2. Start with Phase 1 (utils - safest)
3. Test thoroughly after each phase
4. Document any issues discovered
5. Update this README with actual findings
