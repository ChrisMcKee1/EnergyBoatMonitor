# Closeout Workflow - GitHub Spec Kit

This prompt orchestrates the final steps of a feature development cycle: staging changes, committing work, creating a pull request with modern best practices, and preparing for the next development iteration.

## üéØ Workflow Overview

1. **Check Repository State** - Verify branch and uncommitted changes
2. **Review & Stage Changes** - Identify and stage appropriate files
3. **Commit Changes** - Create descriptive commit with context
4. **Push to Feature Branch** - Ensure remote is up-to-date
5. **Create Pull Request** - Generate PR with comprehensive description
6. **Switch to Main Branch** - Return to stable baseline
7. **Guide User** - Provide clear next steps

---

## üìã Phase 1: Repository State Assessment

### Objective
Understand the current state of the repository before making any changes.

### Actions

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# View all changes (staged and unstaged)
git status --porcelain

# Show detailed status
git status

# Check remote branches
git branch -r

# Verify main/master branch exists
git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/remotes/origin/main || git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/remotes/origin/master
```

### Decision Points

- **Current Branch**: Must be on a feature branch, not main/master
- **Uncommitted Changes**: Identify files that need staging
- **Target Branch**: Determine if main or master is the default branch

---

## üì¶ Phase 2: Intelligent File Staging

### Objective
Stage files that represent meaningful work while excluding build artifacts, dependencies, and temporary files.

### Files to ALWAYS Stage (if modified)

**Source Code:**
- `*.cs` - C# source files
- `*.csproj` - .NET project files
- `*.sln` - Solution files
- `*.js`, `*.jsx` - JavaScript/React files
- `*.ts`, `*.tsx` - TypeScript files
- `*.css` - Stylesheets
- `*.json` - Configuration files (package.json, appsettings.json, etc.)

**Documentation:**
- `*.md` - Markdown documentation
- `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`

**Configuration:**
- `.github/**` - GitHub workflows, templates, spec kit files
- `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`
- `vite.config.js`, `webpack.config.js`
- `.eslintrc.*`, `tsconfig.json`

### Files to NEVER Stage (unless explicitly required)

**Build Artifacts:**
- `bin/`, `obj/` - .NET build outputs
- `dist/`, `build/` - Frontend build outputs
- `*.dll`, `*.exe`, `*.so`

**Dependencies:**
- `node_modules/` - npm packages
- `packages/` - NuGet packages
- `.aspire/` - Aspire orchestration cache

**IDE/Editor:**
- `.vs/`, `.vscode/` (except settings.json if intentional)
- `.idea/` - JetBrains Rider
- `*.suo`, `*.user`

**Temporary:**
- `*.log`, `*.tmp`
- `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`
- `TestResults/`, `coverage/`

### Staging Commands

```bash
# Review what will be staged
git diff --name-status

# Stage source code and documentation
git add *.cs *.csproj *.js *.jsx *.css *.md *.json

# Stage specific directories (if they contain source)
git add .github/ --ignore-errors

# Or use interactive staging for review
git add -p

# Verify what's staged
git diff --cached --name-status
```

### Validation

- Ensure `.gitignore` rules are respected
- Verify no sensitive data (API keys, credentials) is staged
- Confirm changes are related to the feature being developed

---

## üí¨ Phase 3: Commit Creation

### Objective
Create a clear, descriptive commit that explains WHAT changed and WHY.

### Commit Message Format

Follow the **Conventional Commits** specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

<detailed description>

<optional footer>
```

### Commit Types

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring (no feature change)
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks (dependencies, config)
- `ci:` - CI/CD pipeline changes
- `build:` - Build system changes

### Examples

```bash
# Feature addition
git commit -m "feat(api): add boat speed multiplier endpoint

Implements GET /api/boats?speed={1-10} to control simulation speed.
- Added speed query parameter validation
- Updated boat position calculation to use multiplier
- Added OpenAPI documentation for new parameter"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix(navigation): prevent waypoint oscillation at high speeds

Dynamic threshold now scales with distance traveled: 0.15 + (distance * 1.5).
This prevents boats from toggling between waypoints when using 10x speed."

# Documentation
git commit -m "docs: add closeout workflow for GitHub Spec Kit

Created .github/closeout.prompt.md to automate final PR workflow.
Includes staging logic, PR best practices, and branch switching."

# Refactoring
git commit -m "refactor(scene): migrate to atomic design pattern

Reorganized Three.js components into atoms/molecules/organisms.
- Moved Hull.js and Deck.js to atoms/
- Created DeckEquipment.js molecule
- Updated BoatModel.js to use new structure"
```

### Commit Command

```bash
# Single-line commit (for simple changes)
git commit -m "type(scope): short description"

# Multi-line commit (for complex changes)
git commit -m "type(scope): short description" -m "Detailed explanation of what changed and why. Include context that will help future developers understand the decision."

# Interactive commit (opens editor)
git commit
```

---

## üöÄ Phase 4: Push to Feature Branch

### Objective
Ensure the feature branch on remote matches local changes.

### Commands

```bash
# Get current branch name
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# Push to remote (create if doesn't exist)
git push -u origin "$BRANCH"

# If branch already exists remotely
git push origin "$BRANCH"

# Verify push succeeded
git log origin/"$BRANCH" -1
```

### Error Handling

- **Rejected push**: Branch has diverged, may need `git pull --rebase origin $BRANCH`
- **No upstream**: Use `-u` flag to set upstream tracking
- **Permission denied**: Check GitHub authentication

---

## üìù Phase 5: Pull Request Creation

### Objective
Create a comprehensive, informative PR that facilitates efficient code review.

### PR Title Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <clear, concise summary>
```

**Examples:**
- `feat(api): add boat speed multiplier endpoint`
- `fix(navigation): prevent waypoint oscillation`
- `docs: add GitHub Spec Kit closeout workflow`
- `refactor(scene): migrate to atomic design pattern`

## üîÑ Phase 6: Branch Cleanup

### Objective
Return to the main branch, leaving the repository in a clean state for the next task.

### Commands

```bash
# Determine target branch
if git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/remotes/origin/main; then
    TARGET="main"
elif git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/remotes/origin/master; then
    TARGET="master"
else
    echo "Error: Neither main nor master branch found"
    exit 1
fi

# Switch to target branch
git checkout "$TARGET"

# Update local copy
git pull origin "$TARGET"

# Verify clean state
git status

# Optional: Delete feature branch locally (only if PR is merged)
# git branch -d feature-branch-name
```

### Verification

## üìö Best Practices Reference

### Energy Boat Monitor Specific Guidelines

This project follows specific architectural patterns that should be verified before PR creation:

**Backend (C# API):**
- ‚úÖ Uses Haversine formula for distance calculations
- ‚úÖ Dynamic waypoint threshold: `0.15 + (distanceTraveled * 1.5)`
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded coordinates (use `Waypoint` records)
- ‚úÖ Proper separation of concerns (no frontend logic)

**Frontend (React/Three.js):**
- ‚úÖ Follows atomic design: atoms ‚Üí molecules ‚Üí organisms ‚Üí templates
- ‚úÖ Uses `CoordinateConverter` for lat/lon ‚Üî scene conversion
- ‚úÖ Dock-centered coordinate system: origin at `(51.5100, -0.1350)`
- ‚úÖ Status-based rendering with proper material management

**Aspire Orchestration:**
- ‚úÖ All commands through `aspire run` (no manual npm/dotnet commands)
- ‚úÖ Service discovery via `WithReference()`
- ‚úÖ OpenTelemetry configured for observability

### General Git/GitHub Best Practices

**Commits:**
- Atomic: One logical change per commit
- Descriptive: Clear message explaining what and why
- Tested: Each commit should leave the code in a working state

**PRs:**
- Focused: Single feature or fix per PR
- Documented: Clear description with context
- Tested: Include testing information and results
- Reviewable: Not too large (< 400 lines changed ideally)

**Branch Management:**
- Feature branches from main/master
- Descriptive names: `feature/add-speed-control`, `fix/waypoint-oscillation`
- Delete after merge to keep repository clean

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Nothing to commit"**
- All changes are already committed or in .gitignore
- Use `git status` to verify
- Check if changes are in unstaged files

**"Permission denied"**
- GitHub authentication not configured
- Run `gh auth login` to authenticate
- Verify SSH keys or personal access tokens

**"Branch has diverged"**
- Remote has commits not in local branch
- Run `git pull --rebase origin branch-name`
- Resolve conflicts if any

**"PR already exists"**
- A PR from this branch already exists
- Use `gh pr view` to see existing PR
- Update existing PR by pushing new commits

**"Cannot find main/master branch"**
- Repository uses different default branch
- Check with `git branch -r`
- Update TARGET_BRANCH variable accordingly

---

## üéì Educational Notes

### Why This Workflow?

**Automated Staging:**
- Reduces human error in file selection
- Ensures consistent patterns across team
- Respects .gitignore automatically

**Structured Commits:**
- Makes history searchable and understandable
- Enables automated changelog generation
- Facilitates debugging and rollbacks

**Comprehensive PRs:**
- Speeds up code review process
